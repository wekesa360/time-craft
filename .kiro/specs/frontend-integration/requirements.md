# Frontend Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive frontend implementation that fully integrates with the Time & Wellness backend API (v2.0). The frontend must provide a complete user experience for all 12 major backend features while maintaining excellent usability, performance, and accessibility standards.

The current frontend has basic scaffolding with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and i18n support, but most features are placeholder implementations. This spec will transform it into a fully functional application.
