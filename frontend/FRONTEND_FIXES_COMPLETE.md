## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Type Safety & Schema Alignment**
- **Fixed Task Interface**: Updated to match backend schema exactly
  - Changed `urgency`/`importance` to 1-4 scale (matching backend)
  - Updated `status` values to `pending`, `done`, `archived`
  - Added `eisenhower_quadrant` field
  - Added `badgePoints` as required field
  - Added matrix-specific fields (`matrix_notes`, `is_delegated`, etc.)

### **2. State Management & Data Flow**
- **Zustand + React Query Integration**: 
  - Added optimistic updates for task creation
  - Store data syncs with query cache
  - Proper error handling and rollback
  - Loading states managed through stores

### **3. Real-time Features**
- **Comprehensive SSE Support**: Added handlers for all 25+ event types
  - Calendar events (created, updated, deleted, sync, conflicts)
  - Task events (created, updated, completed, deleted, reminders)
  - Focus session events (started, completed, paused, resumed, cancelled)
  - Health events (logs, insights, goals)
  - Social events (connections, challenges, achievements)
  - Notification events (received, read, deleted)
  - Badge events (unlocked, progress)
  - System events (maintenance, updates, alerts)
  - Connection events (connected, disconnected, heartbeat, error)

### **4. Form Validation & User Experience**
- **Enhanced Form Validation**:
  - TaskForm: Updated with Eisenhower Matrix fields
  - MoodTracker: Added comprehensive validation
  - ExerciseLogger: Already had validation (verified)
  - All forms use Zod schemas matching backend validation

### **5. Testing & Quality Assurance**
- **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive tests for
  - TaskCard component (10 test cases)
  - EisenhowerMatrix component (12 test cases)
  - All major user interactions and edge cases

- **Integration Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite covering
  - Authentication flow (register, login, logout)
  - Task management (CRUD operations)
  - Health logging (exercise, mood)
  - Focus sessions
  - Real-time features
  - Error handling

- **E2E Tests**: Created end-to-end tests for critical user flows
  - Complete user registration and login
  - Task creation, editing, and completion
  - Health tracking workflow
  - Focus session management
  - Real-time updates
  - Error handling scenarios

### **6. Error Handling & Resilience**
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
  - Token refresh on 401 errors
  - Rate limiting with exponential backoff
  - Server error retry for GET requests
  - Offline queue for failed requests
  - Detailed error messages for different status codes
  - Graceful degradation for network issues

### **7. Loading States & User Feedback**
- **Enhanced User Experience**:
  - Skeleton loaders for all major components
  - Loading states during data fetching
  - Proper error boundaries
  - Toast notifications for all SSE events
  - Optimistic updates for better perceived performance
