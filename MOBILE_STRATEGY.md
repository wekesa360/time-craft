## 🔄 Code Sharing Strategy

### Shared Packages
- [ ] Create `shared/` directory for common code
- [ ] Share TypeScript types between web and mobile
- [ ] Share API client with mobile adaptations
- [ ] Share business logic and validation schemas
- [ ] Share utility functions

### Platform-Specific Adaptations
| Feature | Web | Mobile |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Navigation | React Router | Expo Router |
| Storage | localStorage | SecureStore |
| Notifications | Browser API | Expo Notifications |
| Theme Detection | CSS media queries | Appearance API |
| Authentication | Cookies/localStorage | SecureStore + Biometrics |
