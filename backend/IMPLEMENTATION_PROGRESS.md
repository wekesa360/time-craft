## üîß **TECHNICAL NOTES**

### **Device Integration Policy**
- ‚úÖ **Mobile App Only**: All device integrations (HealthKit, Google Fit) restricted to mobile app
- ‚ùå **Web App**: No device integration on web platform
- üì± **API Design**: Mobile-specific endpoints for device data sync

### **Architecture Decisions**

- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 for complex analysis, GPT-3.5-turbo for simple tasks
- **Storage**: R2 for audio files and badge assets
- **Notifications**: OneSignal for push, Resend for email
- **Payments**: Stripe with student verification

### **Quality Standards**
- ‚úÖ All new features must have unit tests
- ‚úÖ API endpoints must have proper validation
- ‚úÖ Database operations must be optimized
- ‚úÖ Error handling must be comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Documentation must be updated

## üîß **SESSION SUMMARY - January 15, 2025, 8:52 PM**

### **Completed in This Session:**
1. **Voice Command Processing** ‚úÖ
   - Added missing `/commands/interpret` and `/commands/execute` endpoints
   - Implemented `interpretVoiceCommand()` and `executeVoiceCommand()` methods
   - Added voice notes endpoints (`/notes`, `/notes/:id/audio`)
   - Added voice analytics endpoints (`/analytics/usage`, `/analytics/accuracy`)

2. **Database Service Enhancement** ‚úÖ
   - Added `query()` method to DatabaseService for compatibility
   - Added `execute()` method for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
   - Fixed database interface consistency issues

3. **Test Infrastructure Improvements** ‚úÖ
   - Added proper mock data setup for AI Meeting Scheduler tests
   - Added comprehensive badge definitions for Badge System tests
   - Fixed import issues and added missing dependencies

4. **Bug Fixes** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed VoiceProcessor missing method implementations
   - Fixed FocusSessionService database interface (Database ‚Üí DatabaseService)
   - Added proper error handling and fallback responses

### **Identified Issues:**
- Integration tests import individual workers instead of API gateway
- This bypasses authentication middleware causing 401/404 errors
- Some services still use `prepare()` interface instead of `query()`
- R2 and external API mocks need better setup

### **Next Steps:**
1. Standardize all database operations to use DatabaseService interface
2. Update integration tests to use full API gateway or apply auth middleware
3. Improve mock setup for external services (OpenAI, Deepgram, R2)
4. Run focused test suites to verify individual feature functionality

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES & FIXES FOR NEXT DEVELOPER**

### **üî¥ PRIORITY 1: Test Infrastructure Issues**

**Problem:** Integration tests are failing with 401/404 errors because they import individual workers instead of the full API gateway.

**Root Cause:** 
- Tests import `calendarWorker`, `notificationWorker`, etc. directly
- Authentication middleware is only applied at the API gateway level (`/api/*` routes)
- Individual workers don't have auth middleware, causing 401 Unauthorized errors

**Files Affected:**
- `tests/integration/calendar.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/notifications.test.ts` 
- `tests/integration/voice.test.ts`
- All other integration test files

**How to Fix:**
```typescript
// WRONG (current approach):
import calendarWorker from '../../src/workers/calendar';
app = calendarWorker;

// RIGHT (Option 1 - Use API Gateway):
import apiGateway from '../../src/workers/api-gateway';
app = apiGateway;
// Then test routes like: '/api/calendar/events' instead of '/events'

// RIGHT (Option 2 - Apply auth middleware in tests):
import calendarWorker from '../../src/workers/calendar';
import { authenticateUser } from '../../src/middleware/auth';
app = new Hono();
app.use('*', authenticateUser);
app.route('/', calendarWorker);
```

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### **üü° PRIORITY 2: Database Interface Inconsistencies**

**Problem:** Some services use `db.prepare()` while others use `db.query()`, causing "db.query is not a function" errors.

**Root Cause:**
- `FocusSessionService` and other services expect D1 native interface (`prepare()`)
- `DatabaseService` provides `query()` method
- Mixed usage across codebase

**Files Affected:**
- `src/lib/focus-sessions.ts` (partially fixed)
- `src/lib/meeting-scheduler.ts` 
- Any service using `this.db.prepare()`

**How to Fix:**
```typescript
// WRONG:
const result = await this.db.prepare(`SELECT * FROM table`).all();

// RIGHT:
const result = await this.db.query(`SELECT * FROM table`);
const data = result.results || [];
```

**Search & Replace Pattern:**
1. Find: `this.db.prepare(\`([^`]+)\`).all()`
2. Replace: `this.db.query(\`$1\`)`
3. Update result handling: `result` ‚Üí `result.results || []`

**Estimated Fix Time:** 1-2 hours

---

### **üü° PRIORITY 3: Mock Data Setup Issues**

**Problem:** Tests fail because mock database responses aren't properly configured.

**Root Cause:**
- Badge system tests expect badge definitions but mock returns empty arrays
- Voice tests expect R2 operations but R2 mock isn't configured
- AI services expect OpenAI responses but fetch isn't mocked

**Files Affected:**
- `tests/unit/badge-system.test.ts` (partially fixed)
- `tests/unit/ai-meeting-scheduler.test.ts` (partially fixed)
- `tests/integration/voice.test.ts`

**How to Fix:**
```typescript
// In beforeEach() of each test:
env.DB._setMockData('SELECT * FROM achievement_definitions WHERE is_active = 1', mockBadgeDefinitions);
env.R2._setMockData('PUT', { success: true });
env.R2._setMockData('GET', { success: true, body: new ArrayBuffer(1024) });

// Mock external APIs:
global.fetch = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
  ok: true,
  json: () => Promise.resolve({ /* expected response */ })
});
```

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### **üü¢ PRIORITY 4: Missing R2 Mock Implementation**

**Problem:** Voice processing tests fail because R2 bucket operations aren't properly mocked.

**Root Cause:**
- `createMockR2()` in test helpers doesn't implement `_setMockData` method
- Voice tests try to call `env.R2._setMockData()` but method doesn't exist

**Files Affected:**
- `tests/utils/test-helpers.ts`
- `tests/integration/voice.test.ts`

**How to Fix:**
```typescript
// In tests/utils/test-helpers.ts, update createMockR2():
function createMockR2(): any {
  const mockData = new Map<string, any>();
  
  return {
    get: async (key: string) => mockData.get(`GET:${key}`),
    put: async (key: string, value: any) => mockData.set(`PUT:${key}`, value),
    delete: async (key: string) => mockData.delete(`DELETE:${key}`),
    _setMockData: (operation: string, data: any) => {
      mockData.set(operation, data);
    }
  };
}
```

**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes

---

### **üü¢ PRIORITY 5: External API Mock Standardization**

**Problem:** Tests that use external APIs (OpenAI, Deepgram, OneSignal) need consistent mocking.

**Root Cause:**
- Some tests mock `fetch` globally, others don't
- Inconsistent mock response formats
- Missing error case testing

**Files Affected:**
- All tests using AI features
- Voice processing tests
- Notification tests

**How to Fix:**
```typescript
// Create standardized mock helper in test-helpers.ts:
export function mockExternalAPIs() {
  global.fetch = vi.fn()
    .mockResolvedValueOnce({ // OpenAI
      ok: true,
      json: () => Promise.resolve({
        choices: [{ message: { content: 'mock response' } }]
      })
    })
    .mockResolvedValueOnce({ // Deepgram
      ok: true,
      json: () => Promise.resolve({
        results: { channels: [{ alternatives: [{ transcript: 'mock transcript', confidence: 0.95 }] }] }
      })
    });
}

// Use in tests:
beforeEach(() => {
  mockExternalAPIs();
});
```

**Estimated Fix Time:** 1 hour

---

## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP FIX GUIDE**

3. Fix route paths (add `/api/` prefix if using gateway)
4. Update mock data setup for each test

### **Phase 4: Mock Data Enhancement (2-3 hours)**
1. Add comprehensive mock data for badge definitions
2. Set up proper R2 mock responses for voice tests
