-- This migration marks the problematic 020_fix_focus_schema.sql as applied
-- without actually running it, since we've already fixed the schema manually

-- This is a no-op migration that just serves to mark the previous one as applied
-- The actual schema changes were applied via 999_fix_focus_sessions_final.sql
